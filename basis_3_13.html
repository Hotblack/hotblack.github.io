	<h1>NOTE: Assignment is due at the end of today's class. Turn in assignment before you leave.</h1>
	<h2>TURNED IN ASSIGNMENTS MUST BE LEGIBLE. POORLY WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS WILL RESULT IN SEVERE LOSS OF POINTS. </h2>
	<h2>Assignment grading is based on <i>EFFORT</i>. I do not expect 100% correct answers, but I do expect you to try.</h2>

<ul>

<li><h3>FIRST, REVIEW LAST PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE FROM 3/11</h3></li>
	
<li><h3>SECOND, ANSWER 3 SHORT QUESTIONS</h3></li>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Why did you choose this elective?</li>
			<li>What do you hope to learn for the rest of the year?</li>
			<li>List one (or more) area of computer science/programming you are interested in learning more about.</li>
		</ol>

<li><h3>Challenge Question: Using Math functions</h3></li>
<p>JavaScript has a built-in tool that can generate a random number between 0 and 1. This tool is called a&nbsp;<em>method</em>. We'll talk about methods more later in the class. For now, know if you type&nbsp;<code>Math.random()</code>, you'll get a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).</p>
<p>Using this tool, update your fahrenheit to celsius tempature conversion program to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of inputing a value for the Fahrenheit tempature, use Math.random() to generate a random tempature between 0  and 100</li>
<li>Have to program output: "It is NN&deg;F today. That's NN&deg;C."</li>
</ul>
<li><h3>More information about <em>functions</em> and <em>methods</em></h3></li>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>functions</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>example:</li>
						<p><code>function convertToF(c) </code></p>
						<p><code>{</code></p>
						<p><code>var outputFahrenheit = (c * 9)/5 + 32;</code></p>
						<p><code>console.log(c + '\u00B0 Celsious is ' + outputFahrenheit + '\u00B0 Fahrenheit');</code></p>
						<p><code>}</code></p>
					</ul>
				<li>A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</li>
				<ul>
					<li>example:</li>
					<p><code>convertToF(78);</code></p>
				</ul>
			</ul>
		<li><strong>methods</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>Simply put, A method is a special type of function that belongs to an object.</li> 
				<li>example:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Math.random();</li>
							<ul>
								<li><code>MATH</code> is the object</li>
								<li><code>random()</code> is the function that belongs to the object <code>MATH</code></li>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				<li>NOTE: We will not be creating our own methods or objects in this class. <em>But we do reference them</em>. So a little understanding is necessary.</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>

		<h2 style="color:red">When you finish you will silently take out computers, open CODEHS, and start/continue the Introduction to Virtual Reality course. Look under My Courses and it should be there.</h2>
		<h2 style="color:red">Abuse of laptop privileges will not be tolerated. If you abuse this privilege the laptop will be confiscated. Following that, you will complete an assignment by hand and/or receive a zero for that days work.</h2>
