	<h1>NOTE: Assignment is due at the end of today's class. Turn in assignment before you leave.</h1>
	<h2>TURNED IN ASSIGNMENTS MUST BE LEGIBLE. POORLY WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS WILL RESULT IN SEVERE LOSS OF POINTS. </h2>
	<h2>Assignment grading is based on <i>EFFORT</i>. I do not expect 100% correct answers, but I do expect you to try.</h2>

<li><h3>FIRST, REVIEW LAST PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE FROM 3/11</h3></li>
	
<li><h3>SECOND, ANSWER 3 SHORT QUESTIONS</h3></li>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Why did you choose this elective?</li>
			<li>What do you hope to learn for the rest of the year?</li>
			<li>List one (or more) area of computer science/programming you are interested in learning more about.</li>
		</ol>

<li><h3>Challenge Question: Using Math functions</h3></li>
<p>JavaScript has a built-in tool that can generate a random number between 0 and 1. This tool is called a&nbsp;<em>method</em>. We'll talk about methods more later in the class. For now, know if you type&nbsp;<code>Math.random()</code>, you'll get a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).</p>
<p>Using this tool, update your fahrenheit to celsius tempature conversion program to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of inputing a value for the Fahrenheit tempature, use Math.random() to generate a random tempature between 0  and 100</li>
<li>Have to program output: "It is NN&deg;F today. That's NN&deg;C."</li>
</ul>
</ul>

		<h2 style="color:red">When you finish you will silently take out computers, open CODEHS, and start/continue the Introduction to Virtual Reality course. Look under My Courses and it should be there.</h2>
		<h2 style="color:red">Abuse of laptop privileges will not be tolerated. If you abuse this privilege the laptop will be confiscated. Following that, you will complete an assignment by hand and/or receive a zero for that days work.</h2>
