	<h1 style="color: blue"><center>***We are resetting the class.***</center></h1>
	<h1><center>*************************</center></h1>
	<h1 style="color: green"><center>Let's find a way we can continue the class together.</center></h1>

	<h1 style="color: purple"><center>Our Goal: Mutual Respect & Mutual Understanding</center></h1>
	<!-- 
	I will listen to you. You will listen to me. We will listen to each other.
	I have listened to your concerns. I have judged them to be valid concerns. And I apologize. Adults make mistakes. Teachers too. I will do my best to change the class to better address those concerns. To make it more fun. Everyone here chose to take Computer Science and everyone here is eager to learn more in the class.
	At the end of class, you will the opportunity to direct how the rest of the year will go. 
	But first,
	Let's go over classroom expectations:
	Raise hands to participate in classroom discussions
	Only say productive, positive things in class. If you don't have anything positive to say then don't say it! 
	Make thoughful choices that respect yourselves, your classroom, your classmates, and your community.

		<li><h3><strong>What have we been doing?</strong></h3></li>
		<ul>
			<li><h4><i>The programming challenges: What was its purpose?</i></h4></li>
				<ul>
					<li><p>To show you how to create "cogs". Once you can create a variety of cogs, you can make an entire machine!</p></li>
					<li><p>To fill holes in your understanding of Javascript programming</p></li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		
		

		<li><h3><strong>What are we doing now?</strong></h3></li>

					<li><i>YOU</i></li>
						<ul>
							<li>I want to know more about YOU!</li>
							<li>What are you excited about making with code?</li>
								<ul>
									<li>I asked that question last week. Let's look at some of the answers:</li>
										<ul>
											<li>Games</li>
											<li>Websites</li>
											<li>Drones</li>
										</ul>
									<li>If you could build any kind of software, what would it look like?</li>
										<ul>
											<li>What kind of <strong>game</strong> would you make?</li>
											<li>What kind of <strong>website</strong> would you make?</li>
											<li>Take 1-2 minutes to think about your answer and then we will share as a class </li>
										</ul>
								</ul>
						</ul>
				</ul>

			<li style="color: purple">A-FRAME</li>
				<ul>
					<li>We will continue our work in AFRAME</li>
					<li>We will finish Section 1 this week</li>
					<li>We will review all the material before moving on</li>
					<li><a href="basis_aframe_guide.html">REFERENCE GUIDE FOR AFRAME</a></li>
				</ul>

		</ul>

	<li><h3><strong>What's we'll be doing in the future.</strong></h3></li>
		<ul>
			<li>NEAR-FUTURE</li>
				<ul>
					<li><strong><i>Let's make something in AFRAME!</i></strong></li>
						<ul>
							<li>I want to give you the opportunity to make something weird and wonderful in AFRAME</li>
							<li>The assignment will go something like this: Make me a VR experience using what you have learned in AFRAME</li>
								<ul>
									<li>This is *not* a game</li>
									<li>It is an <i>experience</i></li>
									<li>I want to get lost in your VR creations</li>
									<li>So let's be creative and try to make something cool!</li>
								</ul>
						</ul>
				</ul>
			<li>NOT-SO-NEAR-FUTURE</li>
				<ul>
					<li><i>Let's think of some topics you want to learn more about</i></li>
					<li>I have a lot of passion and experience with lots of different technologies. If you give me something to work off of, I can create lessons based on those topics</li>
					<li>This is your chance to direct how the rest of the year will go so please raise hands!</li>
