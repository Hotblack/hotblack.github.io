<h3>PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
			<h3>The Age Calculator</h3>
			<p>Forgot how old someone is? Calculate it!</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Store the current year in a variable.</li>
					<li>Store their birth year in a variable.</li>
					<li>Calculate their 2 possible ages based on the stored values.</li>
					<li>Output them to the screen like so: "They are either NN or NN", substituting the values.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<h3>The Temperature Converter</h3>
				<p>Let's make a program to convert celsius tempatures to fahrenheit and vice versa, so we can complain about the weather with our friends oversees.</p>
				<p><strong>Reminder:</strong>&nbsp;To convert celsius to fahrenheit, multiply by 9, then divide by 5, then add 32. To convert fahrenheit to celsius, deduct 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9.<strong>REMEMBER ORDER OF OPERATIONS!</strong></p>
				<p><strong>Unicode Characters:</strong>&nbsp;To print the degrees symbol in JavaScript, we need to use the write&nbsp;<code>\u00B0</code> to represent the unicode character for the degress symbol.<strong>PLACE THE UNICODE CHARACTER INSIDE THE STRING</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Store a celsius temperature into a variable.</li>
					<li>Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN&deg;C is NN&deg;F".</li>
					<li>Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.</li>
					<li>Convert it to celsius and output "NN&deg;F is NN&deg;C."</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

		</ol>

		<h2 style="color:red">When you finish you will silently take out computers, open CODEHS, and start/continue the Introduction to Virtual Reality course. Look under My Courses and it should be there.</h2>
		<h2 style="color:red">Abuse of laptop privileges will not be tolerated. If you abuse this privilege the laptop will be confiscated. Following that, you will complete an assignment by hand and/or receive a zero for that days work.</h2>
