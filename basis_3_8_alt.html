	<h1>NOTE: Assignment is due at the end of today's class. Turn in assignment before you leave.</h1>
	<h2>TURNED IN ASSIGNMENTS MUST BE LEGIBLE. POORLY WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS WILL RESULT IN SEVERE LOSS OF POINTS. </h2>
	<h2>Assignment grading is based on <span>EFFORT</span>. I do not expect 100% correct answers, but I do expect you to try.</h2>
	<h2 style="color:red">COMPLETE AT LEAST TWO CODING CHALLENGES</h2>

<h2>The Fortune Teller</h2>
<p>Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?</p>
<ul>
<li>Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.</li>
<li>Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Age Calculator</h2>
<p>Forgot how old someone is? Calculate it!</p>
<ul>
<li>Store the current year in a variable.</li>
<li>Store their birth year in a variable.</li>
<li>Calculate their 2 possible ages based on the stored values.</li>
<li>Output them to the screen like so: "They are either NN or NN", substituting the values.</li>
</ul>

	<h2>The Temperature Converter</h2>
Let's make a program to convert celsius tempatures to fahrenheit and vice versa, so we can complain about the weather with our friends oversees.

<p>Reminder: To convert celsius to fahrenheit, multiply by 9, then divide by 5, then add 32. To convert fahrenheit to celsius, deduct 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9.</p>

<p>Unicode Characters: To print the degrees symbol in JavaScript (using console.log() or println(), we need to use the write \u00B0 to represent the unicode character for the degress symbol.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Store a celsius temperature into a variable.</li>
	<li>Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".</li>
	<li>Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.</li>
	<li>Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenge Question: Using Math functions</h2>
<p>JavaScript has a built-in tool that can generate a random number between 0 and 1. This tool is called a&nbsp;<em>method</em>. We'll talk about methods more later in the class. For now, know if you type&nbsp;<code>Math.random()</code>, you'll get a random number between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>Using this tool, update your fahrenheit to celsius tempature conversion program to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of inputing a value for the Fahrenheit tempature, use Math.random() to generate a random tempature between 0 and 100</li>
<li>Have to program output: "It is NN&deg;F today. That's NN&deg;C."</li>
</ul>
