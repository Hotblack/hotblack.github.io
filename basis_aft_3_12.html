	<h3><strong>Conflict Minerals</strong></h3>


<p>Even with the DRC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fletcherforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Williams-37-2.pdf">support</a>&nbsp;from almost a dozen African countries and Israel, three of the smallest countries in eastern Africa (Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda) are able to fund a war against one of the largest countries on the continent. &nbsp;How? &nbsp;The rebel groups target and control the natural resource mines in eastern Congo, much of the time using forced labor, and use the proceeds to fund their conflict. &nbsp;Minerals from the mines are sent to multiple proxy &ldquo;corporations&rdquo; and are eventually sold to a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.enoughproject.org/conflicts/eastern_congo/conflict-minerals">smelting business</a>, rendering further tracing nearly impossible. &nbsp;These smelters will sell the minerals up the supply chain until they are finally placed into finished products such as computers and cell phones.</p>

<p><strong>What are &ldquo;Conflict Minerals&rdquo;?</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of relevant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/wallstreetreform-cpa.pdf">legislation</a>, conflict minerals are cassiterite, columbite-tantalite, gold and wolframite, as well as their derivatives. &nbsp;These minerals are most commonly used to produce tin, tantalum, gold, and tungsten, respectively, also known as &ldquo;3TG&rdquo;. &nbsp;3TG can be found in anything from aircraft, surgical equipment, and electrical circuits to Li-on batteries, defense products, and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/us-companies-scramble-uncover-conflict-minerals-unexpected-places-1570293">toothpaste</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Action in the US</strong></p>
<p>On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the&nbsp;<em>Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act</em>. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/wallstreetreform-cpa.pdf">Section 1502</a>&nbsp;of this act requires certain public companies to provide disclosures about the use of specified conflict minerals emanating from the DRC and nine adjoining countries. The Act gave the Securities and Exchange Commission&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/conflictminerals-faq.htm">authority</a>&nbsp;to seek more transparency in the supply chain from businesses that use any 3TG as a necessary part of their product. &nbsp;The issuing company is eventually required to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/Conflict_minerals/$FILE/Conflict_Minerals_US.pdf">identify</a>&nbsp;their product as either conflict free, not conflict free, or DRC conflict undeterminable. &nbsp;These disclosures had a deadline of June 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2014 with the SEC estimating that nearly&nbsp;<a href="http://www.law360.com/articles/542598/conflict-minerals-deadline-puts-compliance-attys-on-edge">6,000</a>companies would qualify to make a disclosure.</p>

<h3>Recovering precious metals from e-waste</h3>

<p>According to a study published recently in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, </p>
<p>A typical cathode-ray tube TV contains about <strong>450g of copper</strong> and <strong>227g of aluminium</strong>, as well as around <strong>5.6g of gold</strong>.</p>
<p>While a gold mine can generate <strong>five or six grammes of the metal per tonne</strong> of raw material, </p>
<p>that figure rises to as much as <strong>350g per tonne</strong> when the source is discarded electronics.</p>
