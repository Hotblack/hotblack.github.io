<h1>Color</h1>
<h2>by CHRISTINA ROSSETTI (1830 â€“ 1894)</h2>

<p id="pink">What is pink? a rose is pink 
By a fountain's brink.</p>

<p id="red">What is red? a poppy's red 
In its barley bed. </p>

<p id="blue">What is blue? the sky is blue 
Where the clouds float thro'. </p>

<p id="white">What is white? a swan is white 
Sailing in the light. </p>

<p id="yellow">What is yellow? pears are yellow, 
Rich and ripe and mellow. </p>

<p id="green">What is green? the grass is green, 
With small flowers between. </p>

<p id="violet">What is violet? clouds are violet 
In the summer twilight. </p>

<p id="orange">What is orange? Why, an orange, 
Just an orange!</p>
