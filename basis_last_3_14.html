	<h1><center><i>Where Will Your Plastic Trash Go Now That China Doesn't Want It?</i></center> </h1>
	<h2><center><code>What should wealthy countries do with their plastic waste now that China no longer is buying it?</code></center></h2>

	<ul>
		<li>Some 70 percent of the world's plastic waste went to China – about 7 million tons a year.</li>
		<li>Numerous Chinese millionaires were minted as recycling businesses started and blossomed. </li>
		<li>In 1995, Zhang Yin started a paper recycling company in China called Nine Dragons. She would become China's first female billionaire. China wanted scrap paper and plastic to recycle into more products, and Yin seized the market.</li>
		<li>Conveyor belts deliver tons of trash every hour, with magnets diverting metal and paper going into bins for recycling. Some plastic is binned up, too, if it's recyclable — bottles, for example. But the rest, like a box covered in film plastic — thin flexible sheets of plastic — is not easy to recycle.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>He pulls up a 2-foot-square piece of cardboard out of a 10-foot-pile of trash. "A cardboard box wrapped in our No. 1 contaminate, film plastic," he says. "That's just bad. What is so awful about a cardboard box that they had to go and do this to it?"</li>
			</ul>
		<li>About five years ago, the Chinese government started to worry about all this trash coming in. A lot of the plastic was contaminated with stuff that made it difficult and expensive to recycle – paper, food waste, plastic wrap (which is not recyclable). And some of the plastic was hard to recycle and thus not profitable to import.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>What's more, a lot of plastic sneaked in illegally, without permits. These fly-by-night recyclers dumped stuff they couldn't recycle, causing pollution on land and in waterways.</li>
				<li>"And what we found confirms some of our worst nightmares: dumping in the local canyon of materials they couldn't recycle, plastic in the farmland incorporated into the soil of the cornfields nearby," he says.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>In 2017, the government started to cut way back on plastic trash imports. Then the big bombshell: <strong>In January 2018, it banned almost all imports.</strong> Last year, China took in less than 1 percent of its 2016 total.</li>
		<li>Meanwhile, shipments of plastic waste to other Southeast Asian countries have <strong>skyrocketed</strong>. Exports from the U.S. to Thailand jumped almost <strong>7,000 percent in one year.</strong> Malaysia's went up several hundred percent. Those numbers dropped in 2018 after those countries cut back on imports.</li>
		<li>"That plastic gets separated by the paper factory," he says. "It gets dumped in the neighboring community, and then the only way to get rid of it is to openly burn it. It is also used as fuel for boiling water to make tofu in small tofu factories all around. ... Air, water and land (are) all affected by this."</li>
		<li>These new dumping destinations aren't likely to last. Already, Vietnam and Malaysia are cutting back imports of scrap plastic because they are overwhelmed. They can't handle the huge diversion of plastic to their countries since China shut out imports.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2><strong>Recycling experts say it's a time of reckoning for their industry and that wealthy countries need to stop exporting to countries that can't handle it.</strong></h2>
